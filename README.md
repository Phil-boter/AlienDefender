# AlienDefender

Small retro browser game made with React.js and Firebase.

## About

    This project is my first small game made with React, jQuery and Firebase.
    To start, move the small spaceship with arrow keys of your keyboard
    to the small planent at the opposite side.
    Be aware not to hit the crossing meteors!
    When you reach the planet you get one victorypoint and the clock is reset to ten seconds.
    Now the planet appeas once more at the other opposite side
    and the game goes on until time runs out or you hit a meteor
